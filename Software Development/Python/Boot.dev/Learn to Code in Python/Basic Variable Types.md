# Strings

In programming snippets of text are called "strings". They're lists of characters strung together. We can create strings by wrapping text in either single quotes or double quotes. That said, **double quotes are preferred.**

```python
name_with_single_quotes = 'boot.dev' # not so good
name_with_double_quotes = "boot.dev" # so good
```

# Numbers

Numbers are *not* surrounded by double quotes when they're declared.

**An integer is a number without a decimal part:**

```python
x = 5 # positive integer
x = -5 # negative integer
```

**A float is a number with a decimal part**

```python
x = 5.2
y = -5.2
```

# Booleans

A "Boolean" (or "bool") is a type that can only have one of two values: `True` or `False`. As you may have heard, computers really only use 1's and 0's. These 1's and 0's are just `True/False` boolean values.

```python
is_tall = True
is_short = False
```
