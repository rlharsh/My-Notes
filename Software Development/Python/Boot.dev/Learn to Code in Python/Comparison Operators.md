# What are comparison operators?

Comparison operators allow us to compare two values, and return either a `True` or `False` value.  For instance `1 < 2` would return `True` while `1 > 2` would return `False`.

## Types of operators

| `<`  | Less than                |
| :--- | :----------------------- |
| `>`  | Greater than             |
| `<=` | Less than or equal to    |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to |
| `==` | Equal to                 |
| `!=` | Not equal to             |

## Default values

```python
5 < 6 # evaluates to True
5 > 6 # evaluates to False
5 >= 6 # evaluates to False
5 <= 6 # evaluates to True
5 == 6 # evaluates to False
5 != 6 # evaluates to True
```
