# Variable Names

Variable names can *not* have spaces, they're continuous strings of characters.

The creator of the Python language himself, [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum), [implores us](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names) to use `snake_case` for variable names.

# What is snake case?

Snake case is a style for writing variable names. Here are some examples of different casing styles:

| Name        | Code             | Language(s) that recommend it |
| :---------- | :--------------- | :---------------------------- |
| Snake Case  | `my_hero_health` | Python, Ruby, Rust            |
| Camel Case  | `myHeroHealth`   | JavaScript, Java              |
| Pascal Case | `MyHeroHealth`   | C#, C++                       |
| No Casing   | `myherohealth`   | No one: don't do this         |

To be clear, your Python code will still *work* with Camel Case or Pascal Case, but most developers chose snake case in order to adhere to consistency standards in coding.
