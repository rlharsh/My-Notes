# What I accomplished today
Today I completed a few DataCamp courses, and practiced with GPT #SQL practice problems/exercises. The courses that I completed in DataCamp courses were:
- [[OUTER JOIN]]
- [[SELF JOIN]]
- [[Set Operations]]
Furthermore, I did do some work within Boot.dev as well, completing the following notes:
- [[Inheritance]]
- [[Encapsulation]]
- [[Abstraction]]
I still struggle with organizing all of my notes (especially as they pertain to #SQL). I am quite happy with the way my #SQL notes look at the moment.
# What I want to accomplish tomorrow
Continue working on my file structure for notes (focused on #SQL note organization).
