# What I accomplished today

Today I managed to finally find some time to complete a couple of lessons in #Python dealing with #Encapsulation . I was able to complete the two challenges at [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) and finish my notes for [[Encapsulation]].

# What I want to accomplish tomorrow
Tomorrow Peggy has a full day at work so I should be able to accomplish a bit more tomorrow than I did today. Today was kind of a mess because Peggy and I had quite a bit going on, so I know a lot of things from [[2025-01-01]] were left undone. 
- [ ] Finish chapter 3 & 4 in the #OOP lessons.
- [ ] Finish importing my #SQL notes from Capacities.
- [ ] Work on the #Joining data in #SQL at [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com)
