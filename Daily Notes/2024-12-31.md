Laid out the filesystem for new note-taking method, organized by the following:

- Information Technology
	- *Git*
	- *Shells & Terminals*
- Software Development
	- *JavaScript*
	- *Python*
	- *SQL*

Of course with school starting on 2025-01-21 these folder structures will be expanded and new directories created to accommodate new subjects & technologies.

Plans for [[2025-01-01]]:
- [x] Reorganize the directory structure.
