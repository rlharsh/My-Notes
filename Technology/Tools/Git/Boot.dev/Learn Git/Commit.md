# Commit

Once we have staged a file, we can [commit](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits) it.

A commit is a snapshot of the repository at a given point in time. It is a way to save the state of the repository, and it's how Git keeps track of changes to the project. A commit comes with a message that describes the changes made in the commit.

Here is an example of how to commit all of our staged files:

```bash
git commit -m "your message here"
```
