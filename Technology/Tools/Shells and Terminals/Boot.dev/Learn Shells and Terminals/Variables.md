# Creating and using variables

To create a variable in shell, use:

```bash
name="Ronald"
```

By using the above code you have created a variable `name` with a  value of `Ronald`. You can then use the variable in the shell as follows:

```bash
echo $name
```

By running the line of above code it will print `Ronald` to the console window.
