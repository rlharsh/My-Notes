# Compiled vs Interpreted

A program is a set of instructions that a computer can execute. 

Broadly speaking, there are two types of programs:

- Compiled programs

- Interpreted programs

## Compiled Programs

A compiled program is a program that has been converted from human-readable source code into machine code (binary).

Programming languages such as Go, C, and Rust are compiled languages that produce compiled programs.

## Interpreted Programs

Any interpreted program is a program that is executed by another program.

Programming languages like Python, Ruby, and JavaScript are interpreted languages.

# Shebang

A `shebang` is a special line at the top of a script that tells your shell which program to use to execute the file.

The format of a shebang is:

```bash
#! interpreter [optional-arg]
```
