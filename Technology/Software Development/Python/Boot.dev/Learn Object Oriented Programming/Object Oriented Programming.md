# What is object-oriented programming?

Object-Oriented Programming, or "OOP", is a pattern for writing clean and maintainable code. It is important to understand how OOP code works.

## Clean Code

Object-oriented programming and functional programming are all about making code easier to work with and understand. Code that is easy for the average programmer to read is known as "clean code".

### Clean code does not

- Make our programs run faster

- Make our programs function correctly

- Only occur in object-oriented programming

### Clean code does

- Make code easier to work with

- Make it easier to find and fix bugs

- Make the development process faster

## DRY Code

Another "rule of thumb" for writing maintainable code is "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY). It essentially means that, when possible, we should avoid writing the same code in multiple locations. Repeating code can be bad because:

- If you need to change it, you have to change it multiple places.

- If you forget to change it in one place, you'll have a bug.

- It's more work to write it over and over again.

# How OOP Developers Think
Classes in object-oriented programming are all about grouping data and behavior *together* in one place: an object. Object-oriented programmers tend to think about programming as a modeling problem. They think:
>[!info]
>"How can I write a `Human` class that holds the **data** and simulates the **behavior** of a real human?
## Both paradigms are valuable
#OOP isn't the only pattern for organizing code, but it's one of the more popular ones. If you understand multiple ways of thinking about your code, you'll be a much better developer overall.
