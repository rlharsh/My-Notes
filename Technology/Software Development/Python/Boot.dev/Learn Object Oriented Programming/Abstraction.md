# Abstraction
Abstraction helps us to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details.
## Abstraction vs encapsulation
- Abstraction is about *creating a simple interface for complex behavior*. It focuses on what's exposed.
- Encapsulation is about *hiding* internal state. It focuses on tucking implementation details away so no one depends on them.
Abstraction is more about reducing complexity, #Encapsulation is more about maintaining the integrity of system internals.
