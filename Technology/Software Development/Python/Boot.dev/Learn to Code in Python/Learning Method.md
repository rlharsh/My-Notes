# Outline for successful learning

1. **Read the lesson!** Figure out the examples before writing your own code.

2. **Read the assignment.** Understand the goal of the assignment before you start writing code.

3. **Start writing code.**

4. **Add print() statements.** Don't wait until you've written a lot of code to start testing. Add `print()` statements to see if your code is doing what you expect at each step. It's easier to find issues in small bits of code than in large blocks of code.

    1. Keep running, printing, and fixing until you're confident your code is working.

5. **Submit your code.** 

6. **Compare your code to the instructor's.**
