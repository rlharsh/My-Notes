# What are Binary Numbers?

Binary numbers are "base 2" numbers. They work the same way as "normal" base 10 numbers, but with two symbols instead of ten.

- Base-2 (binary) symbols: `0` and `1`

- Base-10 (decimal) symbols: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`

Each `1` in a binary number represents an ever-greater multiple of 2. In a 4-digit number, that means you have the eights place, the fours place, the twos place, and the ones place. Similar to how in decimal you would have the thousands place, the hundreds place, the tens place, and the ones place.

## Writing Binary in Python

```python
print(0b0001)
# Prints 1

print(0b0101)
# Prints 5
```
