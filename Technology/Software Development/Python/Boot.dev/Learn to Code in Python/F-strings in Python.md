# What are F-strings?

In Python we can create strings that contain dynamic values with the `f-string` syntax.

# Using F-strings.

We can create dynamic strings as follows:

```python
num_bananas = 10
print(f"You have {num_bananas} bananas")
# You have 10 bananas
```

- Opening quotes must be preceded by an `f`.

- Variables within curly brackets have their values "interpolated" (injected) into the string.
