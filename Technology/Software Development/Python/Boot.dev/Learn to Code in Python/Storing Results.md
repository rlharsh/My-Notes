# Storing Results

Now that we know how to store [Variables](RonaldsSoftwareNotes/Variables.md) we can do things such as mathematical operations on them.

Here are some examples of common mathematical operations in #Python syntax.

```python
summation = a + b # Addition
difference = a - b # Subtraction
product = a * b # Multiplication
quotient = a / b # Division
```


Parenthesis can be used to order math operation.

```python
avg = (a + b + c) / 3
```
