# What is the console? 

The `console` in Python is where output goes from our script/program that displays important information, like errors or the text output of a program.

# How to utilize the console.

We can utilize the console in our applications by making use of the `print()` function, which will print anything in between the parentheses out. For example:

```python
print("this is some example text to print")
```
