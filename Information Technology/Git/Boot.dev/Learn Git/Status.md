# Status

A file can be in one of [several states](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#_the_very_basics) in a Git repository. Here are a few important ones:

- `untracked`: Not being tracked by Git

- `staged`: Marked for inclusion in the next commit

- `committed`: Saved to the repository's history

The `git status` command will show you the current state of your repo.
