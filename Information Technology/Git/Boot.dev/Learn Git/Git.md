# What is Git?

Git is the distributed [version control system](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) (VCS). Nearly every developer in the world uses it to manage their code. Developers use Git to:

- Keep a history of their code changes

- Revert mistakes made in their code

- Collaborate with other developers

- Make backups of their code

## Porcelain and Plumbing

In Git, commands are divided into high-level ("porcelain") commands and low-level ("plumbing") commands. The porcelain commands are the ones that you will use most often as a developer to interact with your code. Some of these commands are:

- `git status`

- `git add`

- `git commit`

- `git push`

- `git pull`

- `git log`

Some examples of plumbing commands are:

- `git apply`

- `git commit-tree`

- `git hash-object`
